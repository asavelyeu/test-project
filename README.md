✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro#learn-nx?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run tasks with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

For example:

```sh
npx nx build myproject
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To install a new plugin you can use the `nx add` command. Here's an example of adding the React plugin:

```sh
npx nx add @nx/react
```

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects. For example, to create a new React app or library:

```sh
# Generate an app
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo

# Generate a library
npx nx g @nx/react:lib some-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.

[Install Nx Console &raquo;](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## AI / MCP Setup

This project ships MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for **Nx**, **Jira**, and **Figma** so AI assistants can interact with the workspace, tickets, and designs.

### Prerequisites

The Jira MCP server runs via `uvx` (Python). Install `uv` once:

```sh
brew install uv
```

Export these environment variables in your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`). They are required for Jira and Figma — Nx needs no secrets.

```sh
export JIRA_URL="https://yourcompany.atlassian.net"
export JIRA_USERNAME="you@yourcompany.com"
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-jira-api-token"   # https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
export FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-figma-token"  # https://www.figma.com/settings → Personal access tokens
```

### VS Code (GitHub Copilot)

The config is already in `.vscode/mcp.json` and committed to the repo — nothing to do. When you open a Copilot chat session, VS Code will start the MCP servers automatically. It will prompt you for Jira and Figma credentials interactively (values are never stored on disk).

### Claude Code

The config is in `.mcp.json` at the repo root, which Claude Code picks up automatically. Make sure the environment variables above are exported before launching Claude Code. Then verify the servers are running:

```sh
claude mcp list
```

### JetBrains (WebStorm / IntelliJ with AI Assistant)

JetBrains AI Assistant also reads `.mcp.json` from the project root automatically. Make sure the environment variables above are exported before opening the IDE. Enable MCP support in:

> **Settings → Tools → AI Assistant → Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

The servers will appear there once the plugin detects `.mcp.json`.
